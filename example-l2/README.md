# Example Rollup Documentation
This repository contains an example rollup that integrates with the Espresso Sequencer. 
The example rollup represents a simple key/value account store that receives ordered transactions from Espresso, executes them in the rollup VM, and publishes mock state proofs to an L1 (Ethereum) smart contract. 
The rollup contains a simple API for submitting transactions and querying account balances.

## Introduction
The Espresso Sequencer is a decentralized platform that orders transactions intended for rollups, relying on a [HotShot](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/HotShot) network that achieves consensus on batches of rollup transactions. 
At a high level, a rollup is an L1 scaling solution that performs expensive computations off chain. 
In the case of zkRollups, a prover periodically submits rollup state checkpoints along with batch proofs of transaction validity to the L1. The example illustrated here is a mock zkRollup. 
To learn more about the Espresso Sequencer and different types of rollups, read our [blog post](https://hackmd.io/@EspressoSystems/EspressoSequencer)) or [technical documentation](https://docs.espressosys.com/sequencer/espresso-sequencer-architecture/readme).

## Transaction Lifecycle
The diagram below represents the lifecycle of a single rollup transaction, illustrating how the example rollup interacts with the Espresso sequencer along the way. The diagram below is a simplified version of this [system overview](https://docs.espressosys.com/sequencer/espresso-sequencer-architecture/system-overview), focusing on a single example rollup transaction. 

![Example Rollup](../doc/example_l2.svg)

1. Alice signs a transaction transferring rollup tokens to Bob. Alice sends this transaction to the Rollup through the `submit` endpoint of the rollup API. If Alice is concerned about censorship, she can send her transaction directly to the sequencer. 
3. The rollup API server forwards the transaction to the sequencer. The transaction is tagged with the rollupâ€™s unique VM ID so that the rollup can identify its own transactions in step 4. 
4. The sequencer network processes the transaction, eventually including it in a block. A sequencer node submits the block commitment to a contract on the L1, which verifies that consensus has been reached on the block.
5. The executor service receives notification of the new block commitment via a subscription to a query service provided by a sequencer node.
6. The executor fetches block data from the sequencer. The executor verifies that the block hash matches the commitment from the sequencer contract. The executor then [processes](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/espresso-sequencer/blob/main/example-l2/src/state.rs#L141) the block, performing the following steps: 
    1. The executor filters the blog by VM ID. This step is necessary because the HotShot block may contain transactions belonging to other rollups.
    2. The executor applies transactions to the VM state. Before application, each transaction is validated, and invalid transactions are discarded (a real rollup would eventually include proofs of transaction invalidity). In our case, the block contains a single transaction from Alice to Bob. Since the transaction contains a valid signature and Alice has sufficient balance, the transaction is successfully applied and balances are updated.
    3. After transaction application, the executor updates the VM state with the new block commitment and previous state commitment. 
    4. The executor computes a new state commitment, and generates a mock proof that the state was updated correctly with respect to the HotShot block commitment. 
6. The executor posts the proof to the rollup contract. 
7. The rollup contract verifies the proof by querying the latest certified block commitment from the sequencer contract. If the proof is valid, the contract updates its state commitment. 
8. Bob queries his balance using the the rollup API, and sees that he has received some new tokens. If this were a real rollup, a potentially distrustful Bob could verify his balance against the rollup contract state commitment (the example does not currently include this feature). 

## Rollup Architecture
**[Rollup State](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/espresso-sequencer/blob/main/example-l2/src/state.rs)**

The state of the example rollup consists of:
- **Balances**: A mapping of ECDSA (EVM-style) addresses to balances of a dummy token.
- **Block commitment**: A cryptographic commitment to the latest HotShot block executed.
- **Previous state commitment**: A cryptographic commitment to the state of the rollup prior to the most recent execution step.

**[Executor](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/espresso-sequencer/blob/main/example-l2/src/executor.rs)** 

The executor is a service responsible for fetching blocks of ordered transactions from the sequencer, applying transactions to the rollup state, and submitting [mock proofs](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/espresso-sequencer/blob/main/example-l2/src/prover.rs) to the rollup contract. Rollups often separate the roles of executor and prover into two distinct services, but this example combines them for the sake of simplicity. 

**[Rollup API](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/espresso-sequencer/blob/main/example-l2/src/api.rs)**

The rollup API is a REST API that includes a `submit` and `query` endpoint. With the containerized example rollup running, visit (TODO) for API documentation. 

**[Rollup Contract](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/espresso-sequencer/blob/main/contracts/src/ExampleRollup.sol)**

The rollup contract stores the most recent rollup state commitment. The contract updates the state commitment when it receives a valid state transition proof from the executor.
