# Cleanup script for espresso-network demo

# This script safely terminates all processes and containers started by the native demo.
# It's called automatically by scripts/demo-native when the demo exits (via trap).
#
# Key features:
# - Only kills processes running from this project directory (checks /proc/$pid/cwd)
# - Cleans up Docker containers and networks
# - Safe to run multiple times
