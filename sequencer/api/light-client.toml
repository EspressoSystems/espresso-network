Fetch a leaf plus a proof of it's finality (a chain of leaves leading from that leaf to either a
3-chain of consecutive valid leaves or a known-finalized leaf).

`:number`, and `:finalized` if provided, must both be block numbers. If provided, `:finalized` must
be greater than `:number`.

The returned proof contains the requested leaf along with sufficient other leaves/QCs to prove the
requested leaf is finalized (possibly assuming that the leaf at height `:finalized` is already known
to be finalized). This consists of a chain of valid leaves from the requested leaf until reaching
either
* a 3-chain of QCs
* the `:finalized` leaf

In the event that the latest finalized leaf is reached without encountering either of these stopping
conditions, the proof will additionally include two extra QCs. These correspond to
not-necessarily-finalized views, but they chain off of the last leaf in the provided `chain` of
leaves to prove that this latest leaf is finalized.

Returns
```json
{
    "chain": [Leaf],
    "first_qc": QC | null,
    "second_qc": QC | null
}
```
