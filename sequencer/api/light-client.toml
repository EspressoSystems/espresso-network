Fetch a leaf plus a proof of it's finality (a chain of leaves leading from that leaf to either a
2-chain of consecutive valid QCs or a known-finalized leaf).

`:number`, and `:finalized` if provided, must both be block numbers. If provided, `:finalized` must
be greater than `:number`.

The returned proof contains the requested leaf along with sufficient other leaves/QCs to prove the
requested leaf is finalized (possibly assuming that the leaf at height `:finalized` is already known
to be finalized). This consists of a chain of valid leaves from the requested leaf until reaching
either
* a 2-chain of QCs
* the `:finalized` leaf (in which case the returned QC chain is `null`)

Returns
```json
{
    "leaves": [Leaf],
    "qcs": [QC, QC] | null
}
```
