/// This script deploys contracts needed to run the sequencer to an L1. It outputs a .env file
/// containing the addresses of the deployed contracts.

/// This script can also be used to do incremental deployments. The only contract addresses needed
/// to configure the sequencer network are ESPRESSO_SEQUENCER_HOTSHOT_ADDRESS and
/// ESPRESSO_SEQUENCER_LIGHT_CLIENT_PROXY_ADDRESS. These contracts, however, have dependencies, and
/// a full deployment may involve up to 5 total contracts. Some of these contracts, especially
/// libraries may already have been deployed, or perhaps one of the top-level contracts has been
/// deployed and we only need to deploy the other one.
///
/// It is possible to pass in the addresses of already deployed contracts, in which case those
/// addresses will be used in place of deploying a new contract wherever that contract is required
/// in the deployment process. The generated .env file will include all the addresses passed in as
/// well as those newly deployed.
