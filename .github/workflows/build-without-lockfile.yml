              This means that after this change 3rd party projects may have
              difficulties using crates in this repo as a dependency. If this
              isn't easy to fix please open an issue so we can fix it later.

              To reproduce locally run

              \`\`\`
              cargo generate-lockfile
              cargo check --all-targets
              \`\`\`

              This PR can still be merged.`
