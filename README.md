The Espresso Network is the global confirmation layer for rollups in the Ethereum ecosystem. Espresso's [global confirmation layer(GCL)](https://docs.espressosys.com/network) provides agreement on inputs to a collection of composable blockchains, providing a high trust, fast, and verifiable way to process inputs on any chain, providing fast confirmations in return.

[Official Documentation](https://docs.espressosys.com/network/)

### Architecture

The diagram below shows how the Espresso Confirmation Layer fits into the rollup centric Ethereum ecosystem. See
[Architecture](./doc/architecture.md) for details.

#### ZK rollups integration

In order for ZK rollups to rely on blocks produced by Espresso as a source of transactions, it is required to adjust the
circuit that encodes the state update logic. See [zk-rollups integration](doc/zk-integration.md) for more details.

# Running the demo

Refer to [sequencer-example-l2](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/sequencer-example-l2) for instructions on how to run
a dockerized Espresso Sequencer network with an example Layer 2 rollup application.

# Development

- Obtain code: `git clone git@github.com:EspressoSystems/espresso-network`.
- Make sure [nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) is installed.
- Activate the environment with `nix-shell`, or `nix develop`, or `direnv allow` if using [direnv](https://direnv.net/).
- For installation without nix please see [ubuntu.md](./doc/ubuntu.md).

## Documentation

The rust code documentation can be found at [sequencer.docs.espressosys.com](https://sequencer.docs.espressosys.com).
Please note the disclaimer about API stability at the end of the readme.

To generate the documentation locally and view it in the browser, run

    just doc --open

## Run the tests

    just pull # to pull docker images
    just test

## Building figures

    make doc

## Building and running

Docker images and the [docker-compose-demo.yaml](docker-compose-demo.yaml) file are provided for convenience. The
Docker-based demo fetches the images from the `ghcr` repository, where they are updated with every push to `main` on
GitHub. For testing uncommitted changes, you can also run the binaries by manually building and running the services.

Build all executables with `cargo build --release`. You may then start a sequencer network. First, start an
orchestrator. Choose a port `$PORT` to run it on and decide how many sequencer nodes `$N` you will use, then run
`target/release/orchestrator -p $PORT -n $N`.

The sequencer will distribute a HotShot configuration to all the nodes which connect to it, which specifies consensus
parameters like view timers. There is a default config, but you can override any parameters you want by passing
additional options to the `orchestrator` executable. Run `target/release/orchestrator --help` to see a list of available
options.

Next, you must launch a `cdn` instance, which is necessary to facilitate consensus.

```bash
just dev-cdn -- -p 1738
```

In this case, we run it on port 1738.

Once you have started the orchestrator and the CDN, you must connect `$N` sequencer nodes to them, after which the
network will start up automatically. To start one node, run

```bash
target/release/sequencer \
    --orchestrator-url http://localhost:$PORT \
    --cdn-endpoint "127.0.0.1:1738"  \
    -- http --port 8083 -- query --storage-path storage -- submit
```

A useful Bash snippet for running `$N` nodes simultaneously in the background of your shell is:

```bash
for i in `seq $N`; do
    target/release/sequencer \
        --orchestrator-url http://localhost:$PORT \
        --cdn-endpoint "127.0.0.1:1738"  \
done
```

For running a full demo natively run `just demo-native`.

### Contracts

#### Development

A foundry project for the contracts specific to HotShot can be found in the directory `contracts`.

To compile

```shell
forge build
```

To run the tests

```shell
just sol-test
```

In order to avoid constant warnings about checksum mismatches with [svm-rs](https://github.com/roynalnaruto/svm-rs)
managed `solc` we set `FOUNDRY_SRC` to solc installed via flake.nix.

- To use the contracts from rust generate the rust contracts bindings: `just gen-bindings`.
- Bindings are only generated for contracts in the `contracts/src` folder

To generate documentation in `./docs` for solidity code run

```shell
forge doc
```

#### Deployment

To deploy the contracts to a local testnet, first run a dev chain (e.g. `anvil`), then run

    forge script DeployHotShot --broadcast --rpc-url local

To deploy to sepolia set `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `MNEMONIC` env vars and run

    forge script DeployHotShot --broadcast --rpc-url sepolia

To additionally verify the contract on etherscan set the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` env var and run

    forge script DeployHotShot --broadcast --rpc-url sepolia --verify

Running the script will save a file with details about the deployment in `contracts/broadcast/$CHAIN_ID`.

#### Folder Structure Rationale

- code for demo purposes goes into the `contracts/demo` folder
- code that eventually ends up in production goes into the `contracts/src` folder

#### Benchmarking and profiling

The gas consumption for verifying a plonk proof as well as updating the state of the light client contract can be seen
by running:

```
> just gas-benchmarks
> cat gas-benchmarks.txt
[PASS] test_verify_succeeds() (gas: 507774)
[PASS] testCorrectUpdateBench() (gas: 594533)
```

In order to profile the gas consumption of the light client contract do the following:

1. Set the environment variables `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`, `MNEMONIC` and `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`.
2. `just lc-contract-profiling-sepolia`
3. Create an account on [sentio.xyz](https://app.sentio.xyz/).
4. Use the hash of the transaction generated in step two when calling the function `newFinalizedState` in order to
   obtain the gas profile.

## Misc

### Authenticate with GitHub container registry

This is only necessary to fetch private images.

- Go to your github profile
- Developer Settings > Personal access tokens > Personal access tokens (classic)
- Generate a new token
  - for the scope options of the token, tick the _repo_ box.
- Run `docker login ghcr.io --username <you_github_id> --password <your_personal_access_token>`
