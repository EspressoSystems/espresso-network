# Deploying Upgradeable Smart Contracts

Upgradeable Smart contracts are deployed with Openzeppelin Defender to enable a deployment strategy that is more secure
and also uses a multi-sig Safe wallet. When deploying using openzeppelin the `defender` profile in the `foundry.toml`
file is used.

Note: One must set the environment variable `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` accordingly to use the appropriate profile in the
`foundry.toml` settings. E.g.

```bash
export FOUNDRY_PROFILE=defender
```

The profile, `profile.default` is used by default. Setting the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` variable overrides the `foundry.toml`
settings.

## Deploying the Fee Contract

Steps:

1. Run the Deployment Command This command requires you to go to OpenZeppelin Defender's UI to see the transaction.
   Click that transaction which opens up the Safe UI where your signers for that Safe multi-sig wallet can confirm the
   transaction.

```bash
export FOUNDRY_PROFILE=defender && \
forge clean && \
forge build && \
forge script contracts/script/FeeContractWithDefender.s.sol:FeeContractDefenderDeployScript --ffi --rpc-url https://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com && \
export FOUNDRY_PROFILE=default && \
rm -rf out
```

2. Verify the Implementation contract on Etherscan (Use another window as step would not have completed yet)

```bash
forge verify-contract --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY $FEE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS contracts/src/FeeContract.sol:FeeContract --chain 11155111
```

3. Inform Etherscan that it's a Proxy When the proxy is deployed, go to Etherscan. Go to Contract > Code > More Options
   and select the 'is this a proxy?' option. You should then be able to interact with the implementation contract via a
   proxy.
